# Your Excuse Sucks

More information soon.


## Smooth Scrolling

Done by data attribute that matches to the index. Doesn't scroll if index does not exist.


## Social Share Redirect Pages

For better sharing, especially with Facebook, it is best when shared/liked, that the url that gets shared goes to a static page. Since Facebook and Twitter scrape page metadata, we can customize the title, description, and image for each excuse. These then have JavaScript redirects that just link back to the correct anchor name.
